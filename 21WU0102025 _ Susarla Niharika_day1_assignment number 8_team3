Provide an example of each.**\n","\n","Answer: Built-in Function: These are functions that are already defined in Python, and you can use them directly without defining them yourself. Examples include print(), len(), sum(), etc.\n","\n","Example: print(\"Hello, World!\")\n","\n","User-defined Function: These are functions that you define yourself to perform specific tasks. You can use the def keyword to create them\n","\n","Example: def greet(name):\n","\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","\n","print(greet(\"Niharika\"))\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PeacHjAvRyG9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 2:  How can you pass arguments to a function in Python? Explain the difference between positional arguments and keyword arguments.**\n","\n","Answer: Positional Arguments are arguments passed to the function in the same order in which they are defined in the function\n","\n","Keyword Arguments are passed by specifying the parameter names explicitly when calling the function, and their order doesn't matter\n"],"metadata":{"id":"8HLx5lO0S_XH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 3: What is the purpose of the return statement in a function? Can a function have multiple return statements? Explain with an example.**\n","\n","Answer: The return statement is used to exit the function and return a result to the caller.

How are they different from regular functions?

They can have any number of arguments but only one expression\n","\n","They are useful when you need a simple function for a short period\n","\n","Difference from Regular Functions:\n","\n","Regular functions are defined using the def keyword, can have multiple expressions, and are more suited for complex logic.
